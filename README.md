# DC-Summarisation
Summarisation is a process that occurs at month end. The month end concept is a frozen point where the system computes how much providers have earnt from all of their learners. The summarisation adds up various funding (or payments) outputs into a set of values that are then paid against the contracts that the providers have. So summarisation breaks into main stream summarisation, ESF (funding mdeol 70), NCS (face to face provision) and apprenticeships (FM36 and payments related). The data ends up in a summarised actuals database for future sharing with NCS
